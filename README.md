# Click Dummy Sketch Plugin

Exports a simple HTML click dummy so you can easily prototype flows between your screens.

# Installation
Download this plugin and [put it in your Sketch plugins folder](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/support/developer/01-introduction/01.html).

# How to use
- To create a link placeholder, draw a rectangle and rename it to _linkto:ArtboardName_.
- From the _Plugins_ Menu, choose _Show or Hide Link Layers_ (^⇧⌘H) to toggle visibility of the link placeholder layers.
- Use _Export Click Dummy_ (^⇧⌘E) to export the HTML click dummy.
- Have a look at the Sketch file `Click Dummy Example.sketch` to get started.

# Known issues
- Sketch crashes when there are too many objects on the page. Splitting the document into pages or multiple documents is currently the only workaround we know of.
